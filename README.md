# full_stack_security
The repository contains code that teaches the essentials of building secure web applications using Python. It covers key security concepts, including:

- **Defense in Depth**: Strategies to protect applications at multiple levels.
- **Cryptographic Foundations**: Techniques for hashing, keyed hashing, symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and implementing Transport Layer Security (TLS).
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Managing HTTP sessions, user authentication, password management, authorization, and OAuth 2.0.
- **Attack Resistance**: Best practices for working with the operating system, input validation, and protection against cross-site scripting attacks, content security policies, cross-site request forgery, cross-origin resource sharing, and clickjacking.

The code features practical examples and utilizes important libraries within the Python ecosystem, making it a valuable resource for developers looking to enhance the security of their applications.
